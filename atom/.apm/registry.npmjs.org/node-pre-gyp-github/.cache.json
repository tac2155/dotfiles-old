node-pre-gyp-github\n##### A node-pre-gyp module which provides the ability to publish to GitHub releases.\n\n## Usage\nInstead of ```node-pre-gyp publish``` use **```node-pre-gyp-github publish```**\n\n## Options\n* --release : Publish the GitHub Release immediately instead of creating a Draft.\n\nex. ```node-pre-gyp-github publish --release```\n\n## Install\n```javascript\nnpm install -g node-pre-gyp-github\n```\n\n## Configuration\nThis module is intended to be used with node-pre-gyp. Therefore, be sure to configure and install node-pre-gyp first. After having done that, within **```package.json```** update the ```binary``` property ```host``` so it matches the following format:\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/download/{1.0.1}\n```\nBe sure to replace ```{owner}```, ```{repo}```, ```{1.0.1}``` with actual values.\n\n***WARNING: Variable substitutions are not supported on the ```host``` property so you will have to manually update the version number with every change.*** Failure to do so will result in users installing the wrong binary versions.\n\n**Tip:** Since the version number will be included within the ```host``` you can ommit it from the package name.\n\nWithin GitHub, create a new authorization:\n\n1. go to Settings \n2. click Personal access tokens\n3. click Generate new token\n4. Select all checkboxes (in a future update I will specify which precise checkboxes are needed, but for now...)\n5. Generate Token\n6. copy the key that's generated and set NODE_PRE_GYP_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable to it. Within your command prompt:\n\n```\nSET NODE_PRE_GYP_GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n## Example (Publish to GitHub as a Draft Release)\n1. node-pre-gyp configure\n2. node-pre-gyp build\n3. node-pre-gyp package\n4. node-pre-gyp-github publish\n\n## Example (Publish to GitHub as a Release)\n1. node-pre-gyp configure\n2. node-pre-gyp build\n3. node-pre-gyp package\n4. node-pre-gyp-github publish --release\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bchr02","email":"billchristo@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-12-24T02:26:01.881Z","created":"2015-10-16T19:25:13.171Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-16T19:25:13.171Z","1.0.1":"2015-10-20T03:08:27.124Z","1.0.2":"2015-10-20T03:48:46.789Z","1.0.3":"2015-10-20T04:52:37.967Z","1.0.4":"2015-10-20T05:14:43.351Z","1.0.5":"2015-10-27T03:36:00.721Z","1.0.6":"2015-11-10T04:52:04.507Z","1.1.0":"2015-12-22T21:25:59.349Z","1.1.1":"2015-12-23T20:36:29.419Z","1.1.2":"2015-12-24T02:26:01.881Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bchr02/node-pre-gyp-github#readme","keywords":["node-pre-gyp","binary","bindings","c++","c","native","addon","module","github","releases"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/bchr02/node-pre-gyp-github.git"},"author":{"name":"Bill Christo"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bchr02/node-pre-gyp-github/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"MX3FJPYFBASON5UY6RVWLM6S\""}
