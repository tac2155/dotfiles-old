node-wifiscanner2\n\nThis is a fork of [node-wifiscanner](https://github.com/mauricesvay/node-wifiscanner).\n\n## Installing\n\n    npm install node-wifiscanner2\n\n## About\n\nScan surrounding WiFi access points with NodeJS.\n\nOn Mac, it will use the `airport` command.  \nOn Linux, it will use the `iwlist` command (may require root privileges).\nOn Windows, it will use the `netsh` command.\n\nHow to use :\n\n\t// scanner.js\n\n\tvar wifiscanner = require('./wifiscanner.js');\n\n\twifiscanner.scan(function(err, data){\n\t\tif (err) {\n\t\t\tconsole.log(\"Error : \" + err);\n\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tconsole.log(data);\n\t});\n\nScanning surrounding WiFi access points is useful for getting geolocation. See `geolocation.js` for an example.\n\nSimilar project : [node_wifi_location](https://github.com/swdyh/node_wifi_location)\n\n## Author\n\nFork Author\n* Bryce Kahle <bryce@particle.io>\n\nOriginal Author\n* Maurice Svay <maurice@svay.com>, [http://svay.com](http://svay.com)\n\n## Simplified BSD License\n\n\tCopyright 2012 Maurice Svay.
